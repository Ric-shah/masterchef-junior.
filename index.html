   <p> <b>we can get to the steps to make a cake,
        choose a recipe to get you started. You can keep it simple with
        a yellow cake (pictured above), or you can choose a slightly showier recipe,
        like a chocolaty devil's food cake or a vibrant red velvet cake recipe.
        If you're not a fan of frosting, try a German chocolate cake.
         We also a have a few birthday cake recipes for celebratory occasions. 
         The possibilities are almost endless, but avoid angel food, pound cakes, 
        sponge cakes, and chiffon cakes because they require a different method.</p></b>
    <h2><ins>Step 1 : Prepare Baking Pans:</h2></ins>
    <P><b>Nobody wants their cake to stick to the pan,
         so it's important to prep your pans before pouring in the batter. 
         With the exception of angel food and chiffon cakes,
          most recipes call for greasing and flouring the pan or 
          lining the pan with waxed or parchment paper.
          As for knowing what type of baking pan to use, 
          our Test Kitchen prefers shiny pans for achieving a golden appearance.
           If you use a dark or dull-finish pan, 
           reduce the oven temperature by 25°F and check 
           doneness 3 to 5 minutes early to prevent overbrowning.</P></b>

         <h2><ins>Step 2: Allow Ingredients to Reach Room Temperature:</ins></h2>
        <P><b>Many recipes require ingredients such as eggs and butter to stand at room temperature.
         This allows the butter to blend easily with other ingredients and the eggs will yield a higher cake volume.
         (For food safety reasons, don't leave the eggs at room temperature for more time than specified in the recipe.)
        Never use melted butter when softened butter is called for. It will ruin the cake texture.
         When a cake bakes too quickly it can develop tunnels and cracks,
          too slowly and it can be coarse. Let your oven preheat for at least 10 minutes,
           and use an oven thermometer 
           to make sure it reaches the proper temperature. 
           If you're using dark cake pans, you'll want to reduce the oven temperature 
           called for in your recipe by 25°F.


        </b></P>
       
        <h2><ins>Step 3: Stir Together Dry Ingredients:</ins></h2>
        <P><b>Dry ingredients usually include flour, baking powder and/or baking soda, and salt.
             Rather than adding each dry ingredient individually to the batter, whisk 
             them together in a bowl beforehand. That way you know the ingredients are equally 
             distributed throughout the batter.
   
   
           </b></P>
          
           <h2><ins>Step 4: Combine the Butter and Sugar:</ins></h2> 
           <P><b>
            Wondering how to make a cake with a light, 
            airy crumb? Creaming butter and sugar 
            is the most important step. Here's how:

            <li>Using an electric mixer on medium to high speed,
                 beat the butter for 30 seconds. Generally,
                 a stand mixer requires a medium speed for 
                 this step and a hand mixer requires a higher speed.</li>

                 <li>Add the sugar (and vanilla if the recipe calls for it) 
                     and beat the mixture on medium speed until it is 
                     combined and has a light, fluffy texture. This will take 3 to 5 minutes. 
                     (DON'T cut this short). Scrape the bowl occasionally while beating. 
                     Tiny bubbles will be created as the butter and sugar are combined, 
                     which will give your cake that dreamy, light, fluffy texture.</li>
           </b></P>

           <h2><ins>Step 5: Add Eggs One at a Time:</ins></h2> 
           <p><b>
            Add eggs (or egg whites) one at a time,
             beating well after each. Their protein creates 
             structure around air bubbles to maintain texture.

          <p> <li>[Break eggs individually into a custard cup or small bowl first.
            This way if you get shell fragments,
             you can easily fish them out of the cup rather
              than try to get them out of the batter.]</p></li>


           </b></p>

           <h2><ins>Step 6: Alternate Adding Dry and Wet Ingredients:</ins></h2> 
           <p><b>Alternate between adding some of the flour mixture and 
             some of the milk (or other liquid specified in the recipe)
              to the butter-egg-sugar mixture, beating on low speed after 
              each addition until combined. Begin and end with the flour mixture. 
              This is because when liquid is mixed into flour, gluten begins to form. 
              Too much gluten makes for a tough cake, so be sure to start and finish with flour,
               and not overmix once you add liquid.
            ***Be careful not to overmix at this stage
             or else you might get elongated,
              irregular holes in the finished cake.***</b></p>


              <h2><ins>Step 7: Pour Batter into Pans and Bake</ins></h2>

              <p><b>Divide the batter evenly between the baking pans.
                 Use an offset spatula to spread the batter in an even layer. 
                 Be sure to spread it to the pan edge. Bake your cake according to your recipe's directions.
              </b></p>

              <h2><ins>Step 8: Check Cake for Doneness</ins></h2>
              <p><b>Overbaked cake equals dry cake and no one wants that.
                 Start checking the cake for doneness after the recipe's stated 
                 minimum baking time, avoiding opening the oven door until it's time to prevent 
                 letting the heat escape. For creamed cakes, insert a wooden toothpick near the 
                 center of the cake. If the pick comes out clean (with only a crumb or two on it), 
                 the cake is done. If there is any wet batter on it, bake the cake for a few minutes
                  more and test in a new spot with a new toothpick.</b></p>

                  
                 
                 <h2><ins>Step 9: Cool the Cake</ins></h2>
                 <p><b>Let the cakes cool in the pans on a wire rack 
                    for 10 minutes maximum. To remove from the pans, 
                    run a knife around the edges of the cake to loosen 
                    it from the sides. Place a wire rack over the top of 
                    the cake and flip the pan. Lift the pan off the cake,
                     being careful not to tear the edges of the cake.
                      If you used waxed or parchment paper, gently peel 
                      the paper off the cake.
                       Allow the cake to cool completely
                        (about 1 hour). This is a key step to letting
                         the cake firm up, making it less likely to break 
                         apart as you frost it. (And it keeps the frosting 
                         from melting as soon as you spread it!)</b></p>

                        
                         <h2><ins>Step 10: Assemble the Cake</ins></h2>
                         <p><b>To avoid crumbs in your frosting,
                             brush the cake layers with a pastry brush 
                              before assembling. 
                              Spread about ½ cup of
                               frosting over the first
                                layer, then carefully top
                                 with the next layer. Repeat
                                  until the cake is assembled.
                           Test Kitchen Tip: It takes about
                            2½ to 3 cups of icing to generously 
                            fill and frost a two-layer 9-inch cake.
                             For a three-layer cake, plan on using 
                             3½ to 4 cups.</b></p>
            <h2><ins>Step 11: Add the First Coat of Frosting</ins></h2>
            <p><b>The secret to knowing how to frost
                a layer cake is a crumb coat. To do this,
                 spread a very thin layer of frosting over
                  the sides and top of the cake. This initial 
                  coat doesn't need to look perfect; it's another
                   way to keep the crumbs out of the frosting.
                    Let the cake stand for 30 minutes so the frosting 
                    sets up.
                *** For quick cleanup,
                 tuck small pieces of waxed 
                 paper around and under the first 
                 cake layer on a pedestal or cake plate.***</b></p>

                 
               
               <h2><ins>Step 12: Frost and Decorate</ins></h2>
               <p><b>Using an offset spatula or table knife,
                   generously spread the remaining frosting over
                    the top and sides of the cake, swirling as you go.
                     Once the cake is completely covered, go back and add 
                     more swirls as desired. Serve the cake within 2 hours 
                     or refrigerate to store.
